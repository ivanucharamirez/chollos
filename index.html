The search results do not contain the specific price data across different DEXs (Decentralized Exchanges) needed to identify three price discrepancies exceeding 0.3% between Uniswap and Curve.

The available information includes:

- **Uniswap price data**: Current price of $6.13 USD with predictions for upcoming dates[1]
- **Market share data**: By 2025, Uniswap and Curve's combined DEX volume share has decreased from the 75% held by three protocols in 2023[7]
- **General arbitrage reference**: A mention that price discrepancies exist across platforms (e.g., $1.00 vs $1.05)[8]

However, the search results lack:
- Real-time or historical prices for the same trading pairs across both DEXs
- Specific price discrepancy measurements between Uniswap and Curve
- Timestamp-specific trading data needed for arbitrage analysis

To complete the EVENTO|ESTRATEGIA|DELTA analysis as requested, you would need search results containing comparative price feeds, order book data, or arbitrage tracking information from both platforms.</pre></div>
